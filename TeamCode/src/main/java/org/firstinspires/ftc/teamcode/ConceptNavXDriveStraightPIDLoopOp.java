/*
 * An example loop op mode where the robot will drive in
 * a straight line (where the driving direction is guided by
 * the Yaw angle from a navX-Model device).
 *
 * This example uses a simple PID controller configuration
 * with a P coefficient, and will likely need tuning in order
 * to achieve optimal performance.
 *
 * Note that for the best accuracy, a reasonably high update rate
 * for the navX-Model sensor should be used.  This example uses
 * the default update rate (50Hz), which may be lowered in order
 * to reduce the frequency of the updates to the drive system.
